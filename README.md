# SimpleInputSystem
A simple C++ keypress listener for basic games.

This project consists of a single InputSystem class, that allows the user to bind keypresses on their keyboard, to functions. This can then be used to control players within simple games, or help with interaction of an ASCII based menu (press 'x' to continue, for example).

See examples for self-explantory documentation.
